# AI-Generated Pull Request: Optimize `{bottleneck_identifier}`

This Pull Request was automatically generated by the Zebra Self-Governing System.

## 1. The "Why": Causal Analysis
An anomaly was detected and a root cause analysis was performed.

- **Anomaly Type:** `high_roll_rate`
- **Identified Root Cause:** `{analysis['root_cause']}`
- **Statistical Confidence:** `{analysis['confidence']:.2f}`

**Conclusion:** The analysis indicates with high confidence that the `{analysis['root_cause']}` intervention is the direct cause of the observed anomaly.

## 2. The "What": Proposed Code Change
The Shadow LLM has proposed the following code optimization to address the bottleneck.

**Description:** {proposal['description']}

### Original Code
```python
{proposal['original_code']}
```

### Optimized Code
```python
{proposal['optimized_code']}
```

## 3. The Proof of Correctness (Simulated)
*   **Test Suite:** 100% Pass (Simulated)
*   **Formal Verification:** No invariants broken (Simulated)

## 4. The Proof of Performance (Simulated)
*   **Benchmark:** `p99_latency` reduced from 50ms to 25ms (Simulated)
*   **Resource Usage:** No significant change in memory or CPU (Simulated)

## 5. Risk Assessment (Simulated Conformal Prediction v1)
*   **Prediction Interval:** We are 99% confident this will reduce `p99_latency` to between 22ms-28ms.
*   **Blast Radius:** Low. This is a stateless library function with high test coverage.

## 6. Equilibrium Analysis (Simulated)
This change is recommended as it improves **Speed** by an estimated 50% with a negligible impact on **Cost** or **Accuracy**, representing an optimal trade-off in the current system state.
